A small friendly buddy living on the macOS menu bar, showing the current state of an active ethernet interface.

## :rocket: Installation

> Compatible with macOS 13 or later due to use of MenuBarExtra and LaunchAtLogin-Modern

You can grab the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy/releases). Unzip it and copy it to the *Applications* folder. Have fun! :relaxed:

**Due to local signing, you probably need to run the application again from settings, allowing its execution. In [#3](https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy/issues/3#issuecomment-2204579319) and [#4](https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy/issues/4#issuecomment-2205345477) you can see how this probably looks. The reason for this is described in [this comment](https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy/issues/3#issuecomment-2206266133).**

*There will a brew cask in the near future, stay tuned!*

## :hammer: Compiling

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy.git
```

Open up ``Wired Buddy.xcodeproj`` in Xcode. Some packages will be fetched so let Xcode finish all its tasks, before you hit build!

If you encounter *signing* issues, you could take a look into [üêõ Self compiling](https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy/issues/1), where there is a pretty good description how to sign the application on your own.

## :airplane: Roadmap

Wired Buddy's main features (displaying the active state of an ethernet connection) are already fully functional (*bugs inside‚Ñ¢*). Still there is something to do before releasing a stable v1.0:

- [ ] the AppIcon as a buddy itself
- [ ] Welcome screen on first launch
- [ ] Localization!

If you want to support localizing the app, take a look into the [en.lproj](https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy/blob/develop/Wired%20Buddy/Locales/en.lproj/Localizable.strings), copy its contents. Translate the strings on the right side into your language and open up an [issue](https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy/issues) with an attached text file of your translated strings. You will surely be mentioned in the AboutView of Wired Buddy! :relaxed:

## :heart: Show some love!

You love Wired Buddy? Want to say thank you or just donate something to it's development? You can [tip me](https://paypal.me/kkaj59) something, if you want to and get your name into the app :relaxed:
