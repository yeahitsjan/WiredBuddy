## Wired Buddy :ghost:

A small, friendly buddy living on the macOS menu bar, showing the current state of an active ethernet interface.

### *Installation*

> Compatible with macOS 13 or later due to use of MenuBarExtra

The application is currently not ready for production usage, but works just fine feature-wise. To see if you can help extend the functionality and bring Wired Buddy to a v1.0, see Roadmap below.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yeahitsjan/WiredBuddy.git
```

Open up ``Wired Buddy.xcodeproj`` in Xcode and hit build!

*With a future v1.0 the app will be downloadable via GitHub releases.*

### Roadmap

Wired Buddy's main features (displaying the active state of an ethernet connection) are already functionality. Still there is something to do before releasing a stable v1.0:

- [ ] a proper AppIcon (there is currently none)
- [ ] the AppIcon as a buddy itself
- [ ] Hide the AppIcon whilst running the app as well as the menubar
- [ ] Welcome screen on first launch
- [Â ] Shortcuts / Hotkeys (if any)
